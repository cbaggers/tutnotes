## Who is this for?

This series is for folks who have never programmed before and want to get into this corner of the world. You may be doing it for fun or you may be tryign to make some crazy exciting app, but either way we have to start somewhere and I hope this might be it.

Now for those who have programmed before this will likely move too slowly and so I'd recommend checking out other resources, if you are interested in Fuse we have a pile of documentation and help over at fusetools.com/docs so that's probably a good place to start.

## Why code?

We have computers everywhere, and what is beautiful about them is they werent designed to do a specific thing. Pen's dispense ink , toaster toast bread but a computer doesnt have a specific task. The computer you use to send email, the ones that controls parts of your car or the ones that control rockets flying into space are not fundamentally different. What tells a computer what to do is code.

Code is kind of like a spell, folks used to believe that if you just knew the correct words to say you could make seemingly impossible things happen. With coding we just need to know how to say what we want and it will be done.

Now maybe coding can feel a bit magic, but it's also like working with a bad genie, you know that one that grants you wish so precisely that it kinds of sucks. 'I wish I was made of money' etc

Now like with spells we have to use an odd kind of language. Why is this? Why not just explain things in plain ol' words? Well have you ever given someone instructions and they have done something that is kind of what you asked for but not quite? Human languages have a lot of ambiguity and so its easy to mix things up: Here is dumb example
'Wash that dog in a pink shirt'; is it you or the dog who should be wearing the shirt?

What is worse is that there are tonnes of different ways to ask for something 'can you pass me the bread' 'please toss the bread over here' 'gimme da BREADS'. People have tried for many years to make computers understand what humans mean and whilst they are definitely getting better at working out what words we are saying, what we really mean still is illusive.

Now this isn't to say its all doom and gloom. Smart folks have worked hard to come up with tools to make telling the computer what to do easier and we are going to be using these kinds of languages. We will write in something we can hopefully understand and then it's up to the tool to turn what we have written into something the computer understands.

## Getting Set Up

This is about learning to write code, so we need a place to write and the tool we mentioned just a minute ago. The tool we will be using Fuse, the first reason is that I work with the folks making Fuse and though I'm biased I think it's pretty cool. Also it is able to make what you make work on mobile phones & tablets and because nearly everyone has these devices that is where we want to be!

Let's go get it:

- We go to https://www.fusetools.com/
- Click 'Get Started'
- And pick the version we need. Right now we support Mac & Windows, we'd love to do more but our small team are working their butts off already so other options will have to wait :)
- This next bit we just do what we are told, it'll look a little different on windows but it's very similar process

But now BAM we are done and we should make a new project, there examples but we want to start from scratch so we can take things slowly.

<Create project>

We also need an editor which will help us write our code, so lets jump up to `Tools` -> `Setup Guide` and follow some more instructions..dont worry we only need to do this once.
And then the plugin, this simply lets Sublime (our new text editor) talk to Fuse so it can help us better.

Then we say `Project -> Open in Sublime` and click `MainView.ux` and we are ready to get down to business.

I know that this was a lot of just trusting me and doing stuff without understanding much, but jump over to the next episode and we will immediately get into going through what this stuff is and actually write our first bit of code.

Thanks for watching and see you in the next episode!
